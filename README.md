bridge-bounding
===============

Implementation of the Bridge Bounding algorithm for local community detection. 
Detailed description of the algorithm is available on: http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0871

The implementation uses the JUNG library to handle graphs: http://jung.sourceforge.net/
To get quickly started with the use of the algorithm, have a look at a very simple example (using synthetic community structure) in the bbound.SimpleSyntheticTest.java class (under the test folder).
